# Prework Study Guide Webpage 

## Description

- My motivation came from wanting to learn the basics and some of the fundamentals for the coding languages that I will be learning more about in my Coding Bootcamp courses.
- I built this project in order for me to have notes ready and available for me to read on the topics that I learned while making this webpage for my prework.
- The problem that this project soilves is having a designated location to look at notes for the prework course that I worked on and being able to refer back to them in the future.
- I learned the fundamentals and basics of three coding languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As well as using Git and Gitbash.

In the webpage we have four topics that each have a section for notes that i've learned while doing my prework. The four topics are: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. While on the webpage we can open the DevTools and console where our JavaScript code is running. In the console tab it will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
